<p>The Boxing Day encounter will be rescheduled after the Premier League ruled it was unable to go ahead following the number of positive COVID-19 cases within the Leeds squad.

    Information for supporters who were due to attend the game, as well as its revised date, will be made available via Liverpoolfc.com in due course.
    
    Tickets purchased for this match will remain valid for the new fixture date. The club will email all supporters who have purchased a ticket with details on refunds for those unable to attend the rescheduled date. Please donâ€™t contact fan services on this matter.
    
    Liverpool FC would like to thank fans of both clubs for their understanding as we continue to navigate through this challenging period.</p>
