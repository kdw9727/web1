<p style="margin-top:40px;">Having trailed 2-0 and 3-1 in Wednesday night’s tie at Anfield, the Reds forced a penalty shootout through goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, substitute Diogo Jota and then Takumi Minamino in the 95th minute to make it 3-3.
Caoimhin Kelleher made two saves in the spot-kicks as the home side prevailed 5-4 and progressed to a last-four showdown with Arsenal in January.</p>
